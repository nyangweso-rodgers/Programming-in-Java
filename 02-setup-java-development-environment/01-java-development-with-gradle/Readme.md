# Introduction to Gradle

- **Gradle** offers similar functionality to **Maven**, but with a more flexible and customizable build system. Instead of `XML`, it uses **Groovy** to define its build file which is much more readable and concise
- It uses **Groovy** as its build language, which allows developers to write build scripts that are easy to read and maintain.

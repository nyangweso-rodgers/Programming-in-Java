# Introduction to Maven

- **Maven** is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It provides developers with a way to manage project dependencies, build and test Java code, and package Java applications.

- **Maven** assist with the following:

  - **Dependency management** - makes it easy to manage project dependencies by downloading and integrating them into the project. Developers can specify dependencies in a simple `XML` format, and Maven will automatically download the required libraries and add them to the project's classpath.
  - **Build automation**: Maven automates the build process by providing a standardized build lifecycle that includes compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying Java applications. Developers can define build goals in the project's configuration file, and Maven will automatically execute these goals in the specified order.
  - **Consistency and repeatability**: Maven ensures that builds are consistent and repeatable across different environments by using a standardized build process and managing dependencies. This makes it easier to share and distribute Java applications across different machines and environments.
  - **Integration with IDEs**: Maven integrates seamlessly with popular Java IDEs such as **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, and **NetBeans**. This allows developers to use Maven to manage project dependencies and build Java applications directly from their IDE.

## Advantages of Maven

- It promotes the idea of Convention over Configuration which makes it easy to understand the project.
- automatic dependency management, you don't need to download each and every **JAR** file manually which your project needs,

# Getting Started with Java

## Table Of Contents

# Overview Of Java
* __Java__ was/is a simpler, safer version of __C++__. 

# History of Java 
* Java was launched in 1991 when James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems began development on the language.

* Java was offered to the public in 1995 for usage in various applications ranging from the internet to computer programming.

# Features of Java
1. __Strong Static Typing__ - when you declare a variable, you have to indicate its type. 
    ```java
        int dataValue;
        dataValue = 10;

        int myVariable = 15;
    ```
2. __C-style syntax__. Apparently some people believe this is a good thing.
3. __Object oriented__
4. __Garbage collection__
5. __Fast in the right hands.__
6. __Portable__
7. __Easy to understand most of the time.__

# Why you should use Java for Backend Development
1. __Scalability and Robustness__: 
    * Java has a robust type-checking mechanism that makes it durable. The __Java virtual machine__ (JVM) enables dynamic linking and a secure environment, allowing Java to run anywhere.

    * Java's automatic memory management and disposal collection make it highly scalable and these features help speed up web application development.

2. __Open Source Library__: 
    * There are many Java libraries for various uses, including logging, JSON parsing, unit testing, XML and HTML parsing, messaging, PDF and Excel reading, cryptography, and many others.

3. __Diversity__:
    * Java has long been the dominant programming language for developing Web applications, Android applications, and software tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans IDE, and others.

4. __Security__:
    * Java reduces security concerns and dangers by reducing the use of explicit pointers. A pointer is a value that keeps the memory address of another value and can be exploited to gain unwanted memory access. This issue is solved by removing the concept of pointers.

5. __Platform Independency__:
    * Java is platform-independent, which means it's a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) language.

    * The compiled code (the byte code of Java) is platform-independent and can run on any machine, irrespective of the operating system. We can run this code on any machine that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

6. __Multithreading Support__:
    * Java is a multithreaded language, which means that multiple threads can run at the same time.
    * A thread is a process's smallest unit. Multithreading allows us to maximize CPU use. Multiple threads share the same memory space, increasing the application's efficiency and performance.

# Drawbacks of the Java Programming Language
1. __Lack of Backup Facility__:
    * Java is primarily concerned with storage and does not prioritize data backup. This is a huge drawback, and it is losing user interest and ratings as a result.

2. __Code Complexity__:
    * Java code is extensive, which means it contains many words and long, complex sentences that are hard to read and comprehend. This reduces the code's readability.

3. __Speed and Performance Level__:
    * Java consumes a large amount of memory and is substantially slower than native languages such as C or C++. This is partly because each bit of code must be interpreted into machine-level code. This slow performance is caused by the JVM's additional level of compilation and abstraction.

4. __Memory Capacity__:
    * When compared to other languages such as C and C++, Java uses a significant amount of memory. Memory efficiency and system performance may suffer during cleanup execution.

# Differences Between a Java Backend and a Node.js Backend
* In terms of strengths, Java has the advantage of being a __statically-typed language__, which provides better performance and stability. __Node.js__, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a __dynamically-typed language__, which makes it easier to learn and more flexible.

* Java also provides better security features, such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which has memory protection and isolation. Java also has a large number of libraries and tools available, which makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications.

* Node.js is also well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, thanks to its event-driven architecture. Node.js also has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of libraries and tools for various tasks.

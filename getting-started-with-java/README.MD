# Getting Started with Java

## Table Of Contents

# Overview Of Java

- **Java** was/is a simpler, safer version of **C++**.

# History of Java

- **Java** was launched in 1991 when **James Gosling** and his team at Sun Microsystems began development on the language.

- **Java** was offered to the public in 1995 for usage in various applications ranging from the internet to computer programming.

# Features of Java

1. **Strong Static Typing** - when you declare a variable, you have to indicate its type.

   ```java
       int dataValue;
       dataValue = 10;

       int myVariable = 15;
   ```

2. **C-style syntax**. Apparently some people believe this is a good thing.
3. **Object oriented**
4. **Garbage collection**
5. **Fast in the right hands.**
6. **Portable**
7. **Easy to understand most of the time.**

# Why you should use Java for Backend Development

1. **Scalability and Robustness**:

   - Java has a robust type-checking mechanism that makes it durable. The **Java virtual machine** (JVM) enables dynamic linking and a secure environment, allowing Java to run anywhere.

   - Java's automatic memory management and disposal collection make it highly scalable and these features help speed up web application development.

2. **Open Source Library**:

   - There are many Java libraries for various uses, including logging, JSON parsing, unit testing, XML and HTML parsing, messaging, PDF and Excel reading, cryptography, and many others.

3. **Diversity**:

   - Java has long been the dominant programming language for developing Web applications, Android applications, and software tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans IDE, and others.

4. **Security**:

   - Java reduces security concerns and dangers by reducing the use of explicit pointers. A pointer is a value that keeps the memory address of another value and can be exploited to gain unwanted memory access. This issue is solved by removing the concept of pointers.

5. **Platform Independency**:

   - Java is platform-independent, which means it's a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) language.

   - The compiled code (the byte code of Java) is platform-independent and can run on any machine, irrespective of the operating system. We can run this code on any machine that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

6. **Multithreading Support**:
   - Java is a multithreaded language, which means that multiple threads can run at the same time.
   - A thread is a process's smallest unit. Multithreading allows us to maximize CPU use. Multiple threads share the same memory space, increasing the application's efficiency and performance.

# Drawbacks of the Java Programming Language

1. **Lack of Backup Facility**:

   - Java is primarily concerned with storage and does not prioritize data backup. This is a huge drawback, and it is losing user interest and ratings as a result.

2. **Code Complexity**:

   - Java code is extensive, which means it contains many words and long, complex sentences that are hard to read and comprehend. This reduces the code's readability.

3. **Speed and Performance Level**:

   - Java consumes a large amount of memory and is substantially slower than native languages such as C or C++. This is partly because each bit of code must be interpreted into machine-level code. This slow performance is caused by the JVM's additional level of compilation and abstraction.

4. **Memory Capacity**:
   - When compared to other languages such as C and C++, Java uses a significant amount of memory. Memory efficiency and system performance may suffer during cleanup execution.

# Differences Between a Java Backend and a `Node.js` Backend

- In terms of strengths, **Java** has the advantage of being a **statically-typed language**, which provides better performance and stability. **Node.js**, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a **dynamically-typed language**, which makes it easier to learn and more flexible.

- **Java** also provides better security features, such as the **Java Virtual Machine** (JVM), which has memory protection and isolation. Java also has a large number of libraries and tools available, which makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications.

- `Node.js` is also well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, thanks to its event-driven architecture. `Node.js` also has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of libraries and tools for various tasks.

# Java Fundamentals - Concepts

# Package Declarations
* At top of the  java file we declare package name. We use package keyword to declare a package like..

    ```java
        package org.example;
    ```

# Printing on Console
* To print on console we use,

    ```java
        // Print in Console
        System.out.println();
    ```

* `out` has some other methods. Some of them are:

    ```java
        System.out.print();
        System.out.printf();
    ```

# Build Tools for Java Development

## 1. Gradle

- Gradle is another build tool that is similar to **Maven** but instead of `XML`, it uses **Groovy** to define its build file which is much more readable and concise.

## 2. Maven

- The most important thing **Maven** offers is a project structure, which has a predefined place to put your source file, test file, and resources.
- Advantages include:
  - It promotes the idea of Convention over Configuration which makes it easy to understand the project.
  - automatic dependency management, you don't need to download each and every **JAR** file manually which your project needs,

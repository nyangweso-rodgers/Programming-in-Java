# Overview Of Java
__Java__ was/is a simpler, safer version of __C++__. 


# Features of Java
1. __Strong Static Typing__ - when you declare a variable, you have to indicate its type. 
```java
    int dataValue;
    dataValue = 10;

    int myVariable = 15;
```
2. __C-style syntax__. Apparently some people believe this is a good thing.
3. __Object oriented__
4. __Garbage collection__
5. __Fast in the right hands.__
6. __Portable__
7. __Easy to understand most of the time.__

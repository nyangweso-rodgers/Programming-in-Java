# Overview of JDK
* __JDK__ is a set of software tools and libraries that allows developers to create Java applications. It is a fundamental requirement for developing Java applications because it provides the necessary components, including the:
  * Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 
  * Java Compiler, 
  * Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and 
  * Java APIs.

# Java Compiler
* The JDK includes a __Java compiler__, which translates human-readable Java code into machine-readable bytecode that can be executed on any device with a JVM.

# Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* The JRE is a part of the JDK that allows Java applications to run on various platforms. It includes the JVM and core Java class libraries that are required for running Java programs.

# Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
* The JVM is a key component of the JDK that enables Java code to be executed on different platforms without the need for recompilation. It interprets the bytecode generated by the Java compiler and translates it into machine code for the specific platform on which it is running.

# Java APIs
* The JDK includes a vast library of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide developers with access to various functionalities, such as database connectivity, network programming, GUI development, and more.

# Java Standard Libraries

- Java Standard Library is a collection of pre-built classes and packages provided by **Java** for general-purpose programming. These classes and packages cover a wide range of functionalities, making it easier for Java developers to build robust and efficient applications without having to reinvent the wheel.
- The Java standard libraries provided by Java have some of the most robust and functional libraries including:
  1. Java.util
  2. Java.lang
  3. Java.math
  4. Java.net
  5. Java.io /Java.nio

# Concepts Related to Java Standard Library

## 1. Packages

- The **Java Standard Library** is organized into **packages**, which are groups of related **classes** and **interfaces**.
- **Packages** help organize the code and provide a modular structure. They also prevent naming conflicts between classes in different packages.
- Example:
  1.  `java.lang` Package
      - The `java.lang` package is a fundamental package that is automatically imported into every Java program.
      - It includes essential classes like `Object`, `String`, and primitive data types (e.g., `int`, `boolean`).

## 2. Collection Framework

- The **Collections Framework** provides a set of interfaces and classes for handling collections of objects, such as lists, sets, and maps.
- Key interfaces include `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and their implementations like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.

## 3. I/O (Input/Output)

- The `java.io` package provides classes for handling input and output operations, such as reading and writing files.
- Classes like `File`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, and `Reader`/`Writer` are part of this package.

## 4. Concurrency Utilities

- The `java.util.concurrent` package offers utilities for concurrent programming, including classes like `Executor`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and `Future`.

## 5. Networking

- The `java.net` package contains classes for network programming, allowing communication over the Internet using protocols like HTTP, TCP, and UDP.

## 6. `java.time` Package

- Introduced in Java 8, the `java.time` package offers classes for handling date and time, such as `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime`.

## 7. Security

- The `java.security` package provides classes for implementing security features, including encryption, digital signatures, and secure communication.

## 8. Utility Classes

- The `java.util` package contains various utility classes and interfaces for tasks such as data manipulation, sorting, and searching. Classes like `Arrays`, `Collections`, and `Random` are commonly used from this package.

## 9. Annotations

- Java provides a set of built-in annotations (metadata) in the `java.lang.annotation` package for use in code documentation and runtime processing.

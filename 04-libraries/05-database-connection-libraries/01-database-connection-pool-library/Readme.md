# DBCP [Database Connection Pool Library]

- Database connection pool libraries make the interaction between java applications with database a lot faster to process. **DBCP** enables developers to pool connections rather than creating individual DB connections for every user. Thus saving valuable time and effort. **Apache Commons DBCP 2** is a feature-rich upgrade of **DBCP 1.x **and has improved performance. It supports JMX and can be used in applications where JDBC resources need to be pooled.
